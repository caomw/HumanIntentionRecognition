Scene-Dependent Human Intention Recognition
===========================================

This is a human ntention recognition framework that is appropriate
for persons with limited physical capabilities that determines and
learns human intentions based on scene objects and the actions
that can be performed on them, as well as past interaction history.
This framework is based on a Markov model formulation entitled
Object-Action Intention Networks.
